Django user registration
========================

This is a fairly simple user-registration application for Django,
designed to make allowing user signups as painless as possible. It
requires a functional installation of Django 1.3 or newer, but has no
other dependencies.

For installation instructions, see the file "INSTALL" in this
directory; for instructions on how to use this application, and on
what it provides, see the file "quickstart.rst" in the "docs/"
directory.

Django-registration-1.5
========================
This repo contains James Reynold's updates to Django-registration.  I fixed one typo in his updates.  These updates make django-registration compatible with Django 1.5.

James's description of his changes:
"This is basically a combination of the cbv fork for (direct_to_template is deprecated) and the rejected pull request #30 for compatibility for the new User model"
